# Quantifying Grave Wealth

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mnortoft/QuantGraveWealth/master?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains the data and code for our paper:

> NÃ¸rtoft, Mikkel, (2022). _`r Title`_. Name of journal/book <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx>

The paper quantifies grave wealth from eight different parameters, and uses these to identify potential wealth classes and calculate Gini indices using Moravian Corded Ware Culture (CWC) graves as a case study. 
One of the eight parameters is (estimated) manufacturing time of grave goods. The extensive Supplementary Information (SI) in this repository goes into more detail about how manufacturing time is calculated based on primarily experimental reference data, and then applied to archaeological data from different material-specific parameters. The SI (open SI.html in a separate window or tab) also elaborates on other theoretical, methodological, and contextual aspects that could not fit in the main paper. 
Apart from this, all R-scripts, reference data and archaeological data (grave goods from Moravian CWC and house sizes for various regions/periods as baseline for Gini indices) used in the main paper and the SI can be found in this repository.

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis (both experimental            reference data and archaeological data).
  - [:file\_folder: scripts](/analysis/scripts): Scripts used in the analysis.
  - [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations for the main paper
  - [:file\_folder:
    supplementary-information](/analysis/paper/SI.html):
    Supplementary information (SI) with specifics on how manufacturing time and other value        parameters in the main paper were calculated as well as extended description theoretical       and methodological, and contextual aspects that did not fit in the main paper. 
    - [:file\_folder: figures_SI](/analysis/figures_SI): Plots and other
    illustrations for the Supplementary Information.

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mnortoft/QuantGraveWealth/master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org
Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational
environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from this URL:
[QuantGraveWealth.zip](/archive/QuantGraveWealth.zip). After unzipping:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.pdf`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/SI.Rmd")` in the R console to produce the `SI.html`
