# Repository for the paper "A new Framework for Quantifying Grave Wealth"

This repository contains the data and code for our paper:

> NÃ¸rtoft, Mikkel, (2022). _`r Title`_. Name of journal/book <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx>

The paper quantifies grave wealth from eight different parameters, and uses these to identify potential wealth classes and calculate Gini indices using Moravian Corded Ware Culture (CWC) graves as a case study. 
One of the eight parameters is (estimated) manufacturing time of grave goods. The extensive Supplementary Information (SI) in this repository goes into more detail about how manufacturing time is calculated based on primarily experimental reference data, and then applied to archaeological data from different material-specific parameters. The SI (open SI.html in a separate window or tab) also elaborates on other theoretical, methodological, and contextual aspects that could not fit in the main paper. 
Apart from this, all R-scripts, reference data and archaeological data (grave and grave good data from Moravian CWC, and geodata for raw material sources from around Europe) used in the main paper and the SI can be found in this repository.

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code (or code references) to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated in the paper. See CAA journal for the main paper.
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis (both experimental            reference data and archaeological data).
  - [:file\_folder: scripts](/analysis/scripts): Scripts used in the analysis.
  - [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): illustrations for the main paper
  - [:file\_folder:
    supplementary-information](/analysis/paper/SI.Rmd):
    RMarkdown file for the Supplementary information (SI) with specifics on how manufacturing
    time and other value parameters in the main paper were calculated as well as extended
    description of theoretical, methodological, and contextual aspects that did not fit in the
    main paper. See prehistoricmap.com/quantwealth/SI.html for a rendered version or the same     file at Zenodo
    - [:file\_folder: figures_SI](/analysis/figures_SI): illustrations for the Supplementary
    Information.

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to work with this repository is to clone or download it, and then:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/paper/paper_word.Rmd` and knit to produce the paper (some things were manually edited in official version of the paper and may not appear in the re-knitted output), or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/SI.Rmd")` in the R console to produce the `SI.html` (takes some time to produce)
