Description: This research compendium is primarily used as documentation for the main paper 
"Quantifying Grave Wealth", and may develop into a proper package at a later stage. 
It calculates manufacturing times for archaeological objects (mainly Neolithic) 
based on experimental reference literature and interviews with crafts specialists. 
To do this, several measurement details and it is necessary to follow the structure given in the material specific tables (for your own data, 
copy them and replace values with your data). The system only works for object types covered in the system (mainly from the Neolithic and Copper Age), 
and it is important that the exact same object terminology is used for the system to recognize. See the SI reference tables in each material section for the working terminology.
Skill bonus is calculated as a percentage of manufaturing hours based on estimations of the required training (in years) to make the different objects 
(see again reference tables for required terminology) in different levels, see SI for details. 
Manufacturing time for ceramics depends on many different factors, many of which are connected with pot size, see SI for details. 
The different material scripts also show exactly which terminology to use in what case, but the reference tables in the SI should also show this.
Manufaturing times can be combined with estimated travel times (e.g. in hours assuming here 7 km/h) for imported raw materials, 
and scarcity (total number of graves/total number of artefacts of x material). 
An additional prestige value can be calculated as follows: 
generate presence/absence table of grave good categories and get the Total number of Object Types (TOT) for each grave, 
then take TOT median for each grave good category (a.k.a. "Object Type"), see the script prestigeObjectsBoxPlots.R in 
this compendium but modify to fit your grave good categories or follow the structure given in the 
data file "data/grave_goods_raw_count.csv". 
The Prestige.R script exctracts the TOT medians for each grave good category and applies them as values instead of 
the raw grave good counts (in a new table). 
Estimated meat is calculated by applying Meat Utility Indices of different species to the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI)
of unworked animal bones (some species indices not found in the literature, and thus extrapolated from other species) 
found in each grave.
